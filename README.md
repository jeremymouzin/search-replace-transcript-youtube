# How does it works?

1. Log yourself into YouTube
2. Open YouTube Studio
3. Select the "Subtitles" category on the left panel
4. Select the video you want to edit the subtitles from
(at this step the URL should start by https://studio.youtube.com/channel/<your_channel_ID>/translations or https://studio.youtube.com/video/<your_channel_ID>/translations)
5. Click on the "edit" or "duplicate and edit" button next to the subtitle you want to edit
6. **WARNING: You MUST use the mode "edit as text" for the extension to work properly. So tap on this button in order to put the entire text of subtitles in one big block of text. That way the extension can search and replace in the whole text otherwise it will modify only a part of the text that is currently displayed in the interface.**
7. You can now use this extension, enjoy!
